# IOT-Based-Smart-Street-Light-System-
 Welcome to the Smart Street Light Management Systemâ€”a project optimizing energy use and enhancing road safety through automated, efficient lighting.


Key Features:

1. Energy Efficiency:
    Our system is equipped with intelligent light sensors that allow for precise control over street light activation. By responding to ambient light conditions, the system ensures that energy is consumed only when required, minimizing power wastage and contributing to a more sustainable environment.

2. Safety Focus:
   A central tenet of the project is to enhance road safety. The system's capability to automatically illuminate dark areas creates a safer environment for pedestrians and drivers alike. This proactive approach plays a crucial role in mitigating potential safety risks on roads and highways.

3. Cost Savings:
   The selective activation of street lights translates into tangible cost savings. By optimizing energy usage and reducing unnecessary illumination, the project frees up financial resources that can be redirected to more impactful initiatives, aligning with broader developmental goals.
